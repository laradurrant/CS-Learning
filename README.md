# CS-Learning
A small hub of learning materials for basic computer science concepts

Topics to cover:
## Algorithms
  * “Big O Notation” or AKA “Runtime complexity”
    * A way to classify algorithms & how long they take to run
    * [Guide from Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/java/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity)
    * [Guide from MIT](http://web.mit.edu/16.070/www/lecture/big_o.pdf)
  * Linked Lists
  * Linear Search
    * What would happen if you searched every item from start to finish
    * So in a number choosing game, you would start with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc
  * Binary Trees
    * An efficient search algorithm that divides a sorted list in half 
      * Commonly used in a lot of guessing games
      * Can be used for maze pathfinding with a grid
      * This is the algorithm we used in the Number Wizard game from Udemy
      * With a list of numbers between 1 and 100, you would want to guess 50 first, then 25, etc
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Bubble Sort
