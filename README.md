# CS-Learning
A small hub of learning materials for basic computer science concepts

Topics to cover:
## Algorithms
  * “Big O Notation” or AKA “Runtime complexity”
    * A way to classify algorithms & how long they take to run
    * [Guide from Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/java/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity)
    * [Guide from MIT](http://web.mit.edu/16.070/www/lecture/big_o.pdf)
  * Linked Lists
  * Binary Trees
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Bubble Sort
